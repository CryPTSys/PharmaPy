PharmaPy is a pythonic library for the analysis of pharmaceutical manufacturing systems.

It allows to simulate the dynamics of standalone, drug substance unit operations in a variety of operating modes (batch, continuous, semibatch). Also, PharmaPy facilitates setting up and simulating pharmaceutical **flowsheets**, i.e., interconnected unit operations in a variety of operation modes, ranging from end-to-end batch, end-to-end continuous, and hybrid operation (combination of batch and/or continuous and semicontinuous unit operations).

## Getting started
To install PharmaPy, download and unzip the code from the release section, and then follow the instructions on the `install_instructions.txt` file.
