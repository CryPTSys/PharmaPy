Welcome to PharmaPy's documentation!
====================================

PharmaPy is an open-source library for the analysis of pharmaceutical manufacturing systems. Some of its features are:

* Fully dynamic models (ODEs and DAEs) of commonly found unit operations on the drug substance side of pharmaceutical manufacturing  
* Start-up modeling, disturbance analysis
* Fully sequential-modular approach: each unit is simulated individually in a pre-defined sequence
* Allows decoupling of continuous/discontinuous sections of a flowsheet
* Flexible modeling for batch/hybrid/continuous flowsheets
* Utilize robust numerical integrators: SUNDIALS through python package Assimulo (ODE/DAE simulation)
* In-house implementation of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for Parameter Estimation
* Simulate flowsheets, estimate kinetic parameters, optimize process conditions with external tools
